<h1> Welcome </h1>

<hr>

<h4> My name is Arturo Flores. I am a third year student at the California State University in Fullerton. </h4>

<hr>

<h4> Experience </h4>
<p> Over the past three years, I have learned to code in three different languages, Java, C++, and Python, and continue to learn as much as I can as I continue my journey. My reach of experience extends from creating clean, well-thought-out, and efficient projects for the courses I have taken, such as creating an online grade book to work on Visual Studioâ€™s IDE, to planning, designing, and creating a a mock-up of an online bookstore for a fictional boutique with a group of other students. </p>


<h4> Design </h4>
<p>  I have learned to become an organized, focused, and determined person who will take the time and patience to communicate with clients in order to listen to their unique situations, offer solutions, and implement their solutions so my clients can see their vision come to life on their screens. <p>
