                <p>
                    Over the past three years, I have learned to code in three different languages, Java, C++, and Python, and I continue to learn new concepts as I pursue a computer science-related career. 
                    I have also taken several computer-science-related courses that have helped improve my design, conceptual, and hardware skills, such as Data Science, Software Engineering, and Computer Architecture. 
                    My reach of experience extends from creating clean, well-thought-out, and efficient projects for the courses I have taken, such as creating an online grade book to work on Visual Studioâ€™s IDE, to planning, designing, and creating a a mock-up of an online bookstore for a fictional boutique with a group of other students.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I have learned to become an organized, focused, and determined person who will take the time and patience to communicate with clients to listen to their unique situations, offer solutions, and implement their solutions so my clients can see their vision come to life on their screens.
